<p>William Blake(28 November 1757 - 12August 1827) was  an English poet, painter and printmaker. Largely unrecognised during is life, BLake is now considered a semifinal figure in the history of the poetry and visual art of the Romantic Age. What he called his"prophetic works" were said by 20th centuty critic Northrop FRye to form" what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English Language" [2] His visual artistry led 21st century critic Jonathan  Jones to proclaim  him"far and away" the greatest artist Britain has ever prouduced". [3] In 2002, Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBCs poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. [4]While he lived in London his entire life, except for 3 years spent in Felpham,[5] he prouduced a diverse and symbolically rch collection of works, which embraced the imagination as"Body of God"[6] or human existence itself.</p>
